# Day - 1: Redis - https://youtu.be/OqCK95AS-YE

- **Re**mote **di**ctionary **s**erver
- In-memory database
- Data stored on computer's memory
- Often used as **Cache** to improve performance
- Persist multiple data formats

- [1] Redis delivers sub-millisecond response times, enabling fast and powerful real-time applications in industries such as gaming, fintech, ad-tech, social media, healthcare, and IoT.

- [1] Both Redis and Memcached are open source, powerful, in-memory data stores. The main difference between the two is that Redis is a more full-featured database that is built to fit a number of different use cases. Memcached is primarily used for key/value caching. Redis is used for both caching and as a database.

- [2] To achieve top performance, Redis works with an in-memory dataset.

# Day - 2

- An in-memory dataset is a collection of data that is stored and manipulated in the main memory of a computer, rather than on a disk or other external storage device. It can be used for fast and efficient data processing, analysis, or caching[5][6].

- An in-memory dataset works by loading the data into the memory of the computer, where it can be accessed and modified directly by the application or program that uses it. This eliminates the need to read and write data from a disk, which can be slow and costly in terms of performance and resources[5][6]. An in-memory dataset can also take advantage of the memory's structure and organization, such as using columns, indexes, or compression techniques, to optimize the data for specific operations or queries[6][3].

- However, an in-memory dataset also has some drawbacks, such as the risk of losing data if the memory fails or the process crashes. To prevent data loss, an in-memory dataset can use various techniques to persist the data on a disk, such as logging each operation or taking snapshots at regular intervals[5][6]. Another challenge is the limited size of the memory compared to the disk, which may limit the amount of data that can be stored and processed in memory. To overcome this limitation, an in-memory dataset can use distributed systems or cloud services to scale horizontally and use multiple nodes or servers to store and process the data[6][8].
